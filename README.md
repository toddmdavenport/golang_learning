# Notes and exercises from learning the Go programming language

I started out trying to lear Go with [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)
course from Udemy.

As has been the case before, I found that the first course was not in line with
how I learn. After a period of initial focus and energy wore off, I was not
retaining what I was learning and eventually I fell behind schedule and stopped.

I still wanted very much to learn the language, but could not motivate myself
to review my notes and move on in the lessons.

I started to look around for another course. I found
[Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go)

After watching the introduction I decided to give give it a Go ;). Why?

- It's a project-based curriculum with a clear goal in mind
- It teaches skills that are directly related to the things I want to do with Go
- I like the demeanor of the instructor

So here goes tke 2. Hope it gets me closer to where I want to be.
